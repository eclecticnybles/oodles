# OODLES
It's not an acronym it's just very loud.

A single user program for writing in a twitter-thread-like way, but more powerful.

## TODO
Yeah, I'm putting this in the readme I guess. Anyway we're on a plane and don't want to pay for the WiFi so no GitHub issues for us!

- [ ] We never check someone has permission to post an oodle or to modify it. When we implement delete, we should make sure about that, too.
- [ ] Everything is unwrapped and it's bad.
- [x] We can edit :D ~~We want to be able to edit~~
- [ ] Some kind of user data system- or, well, we can have a button to "detect timezone via Javascript" and then save that in a cookie. That'd be neat.
